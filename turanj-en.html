<h1>turanj</h1> <p>Turanj
is the center of the world. My world. It is simply center of my
memories from childhood and adolescence until now. There were some bad
memories too, but children have their own way of going through war. But
there is much more good memories, and this kind is stronger and much
more clear. Then, there is the sea. Growing up near (and with) the sea
makes you a bit different person. And Turanj is placed on Adriatic sea,
in an idyllical Mediterranean ambient and my house is only 50 meters from
the coast.</p> <p><a href="slike/fotogalerija/2008.10.05@10.30.00.jpg" title="Panoramic view of Turanj">

<p>Turanj is an attractive tourist village, with population of about 1200, 
<a href="gmap-en.html" title="Turanj from satellite"><img src="slike/arhipelag.jpg" alt="Turanj from satellite" width="250" height="396" border="0" align="right" /></a>placed on a
very beautiful spot surrounded by 16 small islands. It spreads over
about 3 miles of Pa&scaron;man canal coast. It is placed between
Biograd and Zadar, which makes it a quiet and peaceful Mediterranean
village still close to center of region. In summertime Turanj becomes
quite a little paradise. With it's crystal clear sea and 15 tiny
islands around it simply attracts people. People who have seen it once
keep coming back to enjoy it's irresistible ambient again and again.
Autumn and winter change it's face and cold wind forces people to get
inside their houses as soon as sun goes down. But winter days are
mostly beautiful, with sunny and clear sky. </p>

Turanj area was almost constantly populated since Bronze Age, and the oldest 
archaeological remains are dated in early Stone Age. In Bronze Age there were
settlements around Turanj area, mostly placed on nearby hills and the
remains of one of them were even found on island Ričul (Zeleni
&scaron;kolj - Green island). At that time island was really a
peninsula connected with shore, so it was perfect for building a little
antic port. In the age of Roman empire a great Roman villa was built
there, because of its position from which it was possible to control
ships passing through Pa&scaron;man canal. Later on a village called
Tukljača was settled there and a church was built on
foundations of Roman villa. Church was consecrated to saint Mary
(Stella Maris).</p> <p>Name of Turanj first appeared in
historical documents in the 13th century. In the year of 1444 Croatian
aristocratic family Me&scaron;trović built a fort two miles
to the southeast of Tukljača, and Turanj was named after that
fort (from Latin turis, which means fort). Fort was built on the very
coast, and walls were supported by three towers. One of these towers
still exists along with a few parts of fort walls and the main gate. </p>
<p>At the age of wars with Turks Turanj was attacked and burnt
down few times, and population was forced to escape on nearby islands
to survive. Inside Turanj walls there was a church of Mala Gospa
(Ružarica), which was burnt down during the war by Ibrahim
pasha, but later a new church was built on that spot and consecrated to
Gospa od Karmela (Lady of Carmel).</p> <p>One interesting
thing is that in the year of 1527 Turanj had population of 144, while
Biograd (which is a region center now) had only 70 at that time.</p>
